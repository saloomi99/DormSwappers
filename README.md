Overview: The main function of our app will allow BU students to see the available rooms from the database across BU's campus. Our app
includes features that will allow the users to register and login into their own account. The users will be asked to input their the name
and the location of the buildings so that they become part of the database. Through the app, the users can select the loaction and the
name of the building they want to see. Then on the final page, the contact information of the person living there will be shown so that if
they want to swap they can contact each other.

Overview on building the project:
We choose to make an Android app using Android studio which is for Google's Android operating system. We had to code the app using 
Java. Most, We built the app by creating a login page that has some space for texts and a button that will allow the user to move into
the next page. All of the other pages of the app and the process were built by using buttons to move from one page to the other and by using texts that show the displayed information.The program of Android Studio offers many  features that enhance the productivity when building Android apps as it contains a flexible Gradle-based build system and a fast emulator that allows us to see the process.
